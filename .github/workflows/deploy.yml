# Deploy to GitHub Pages
# Site: https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/
#
# IMPORTANT: In the repo go to Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
# and set Source to "GitHub Actions". If it's "Deploy from a branch",
# the site will serve raw source (index.html pointing to /src/main.tsx)
# and you'll get a white page and 404 for /src/main.tsx.
#
# To trigger from another branch (e.g. "deploy"), change "main" under on.push.branches.
